Simple Documentation Manager
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/l0CAxQ_cU58
#### Description:
My goal was to extend my web programming skills that I have gained during the classes. This is why I have decided to create a web-oriented project. A Simple Documentation Manager allows the users to store simple documentation of their projects/thoughts. Add documentation overlap permit you to add your project. My documentation displays a quick view of the projects and pressing the view button will lead to a more detailed menu containing readme and code.
##### Technologies in use:
During development, I have used Flask library for the backend. SQLite3 as a database and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front end.
#### Nice to have:
 - The registration process requires Email verification.
 - README field in the Add Documenatation supports Markdown file format.
 - Input fields automatically extend their size whenever you press enter button
