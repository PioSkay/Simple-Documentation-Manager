# Simple-Documentation-Manager
In this project, I have decided to design a simple website. The general idea was to create a manager of information regarding the user's simple programming projects. For the backend, I have used Python/Flask. To store the data I took advantage of SQLite3. And for the front end mainly HTML/CSS with a little bit of JavaScript.
